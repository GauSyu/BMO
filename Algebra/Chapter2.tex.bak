\chapter{Preface}
Roughly speaking, this book is an anthology of solutions to Serge Lang's \emph{Algebra} i.e.\cite{lang2002algebra}. The editor did not collect all solutions, but some interesting topics. Based on these exercises, editor may introduce some related concepts and conclusions. Since many concepts and notations have been given in Lang's textbook, this book will follow it and omit detail explain. During editing, some related books and articles give great help.

Thanks to all.
