\chapter{Preface}

Roughly speaking, this book is an collection of solutions to Serge Lang's \emph{Algebra} i.e.\cite{lang2002algebra}. 
However, it doesn't cover solutions of all exercises, but some interesting topics. 
In addition to these exercises, I try to introduce some related concepts and conclusions. 
Since many concepts and notations have been given in Lang's textbook, I will follow it and omit detail explain. 

Furthermore, this book is also a note for a inofficial seminar after school whose theme is to learn some systematic knowledge about algebra. 
The main reference material is of course Serge Lang's \emph{Algebra}. Besides, some related books and articles given great help.

Thanks to all.
