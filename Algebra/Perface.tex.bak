\chapter{Preface}
Roughly speaking, this book is an anthology of solutions to Serge Lang's \emph{Algebra} i.e.\cite{lang2002algebra}. 
I did not collect solutions of all exercises, but some interesting topics. 
In addition to these exercises, I try to introduce some related concepts and conclusions. 
Since many concepts and notations have been given in Lang's textbook, this book will follow it and omit detail explain. 

During editing, some related books and articles give great help.

Thanks to all.
