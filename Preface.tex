This is a collection of notes for our seminar on Algebra.

At first, it was designed as a collection of solutions to Serge Lang's \emph{Algebra}, i.e. \cite{lang2002algebra}.
However, it doesn't cover solutions of all exercises, but some interesting topics.

In addition to these exercises, I try to introduce some related concepts and conclusions.
Furthermore, I add some notes for a inofficial seminar after school whose theme is to learn some systematic knowledge about algebra.

After one year of march, abandoning step-by-step biting, we start a series of seminar on interesting topics. Thus, this book become far from an exercise solution.

Based on this reason, I rearrange this book and rename it as \emph{Seminar notes on Algebra}.

The main reference material is still Serge Lang's \emph{Algebra}. Besides, some related books and articles, especially \emph{Wikipedia}, give great help.

Thanks to all.
