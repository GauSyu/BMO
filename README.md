# Basic Math Object
Basic Math Object (BMO for short) is a suspended project aim to organize the basic notions and facts used in mathematics under the philosophy of category theory.

The original reason to start this project is to produce a standard support for my notes. However, it waste too much time, especially for an old student waiting for admission from graduate school. So this project has been suspended since last year. This update is just a repertory transportation.
